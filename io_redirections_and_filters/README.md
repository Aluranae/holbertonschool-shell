# Shell, Permisssions

In this project I learned how permissions work in Shell through 16 tasks.

*However, here are the requirements that have been requested:*

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line (why?)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
* You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
* All your files must be executable
* You are not allowed to use sed or awk




# **What does it do?**

## **An explanation of how each script and permissions works**


### **Task 0**
* [Hello World](https://github.com/Aluranae/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/permissions/0-hello_world)

While using the _su_ command the script prints "Hello, World", followed by a new line to the standard output.
