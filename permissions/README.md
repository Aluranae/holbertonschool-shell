# Shell, Permisssions

In this project I learned how permissions work in Shell through 16 tasks.

*However, here are the requirements that have been requested:*

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line (why?)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
* You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
* All your files must be executable

*Warning: tasks 3 / 13 / 14 / 15 / 16 must be done inside the sandbox in order to be corrected by the checker.*
