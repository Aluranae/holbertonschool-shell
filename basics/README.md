# Shell Basics

In this project I discovered and learned the basics of Shell through 17 tasks.

*However, here are the requirements that have been requested:*
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
* A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
* I am not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
* All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file.




# **What does it do?**

## **An explanation of how each script works**

### **Task 0**
* Where I Am?
While using the _pwd_ command the script prints the absolute path name of the current working directory.

### **Task 1**
* What's in there?
With the the _ls_ command, the script display the contents list of the current directory.
